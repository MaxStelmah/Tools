# Tools

Here I am going to post some part of my framework, which is making live, development and tests easier.

### FilesLib.py - library for handling files and folders (list files, copy files, clear folders ...)

#### def copyDifferentImages(folderForScanningImages, folderForResImages, filterPersent) # you can filter you images to find some specific pictures

### ImagesLib.py - library for handling Images (find different images, blend images ...)

### ParsedLog.py - very simple class for handling logs.

### GraphTimeLine.py - the tool for comparing results on a timescale. For example use autovision_v1 and autovision_v2 folders to see, how GrapTimeline working is. See the screenshot below.

### svc checker - is a simple but wonderful tool to show you which Windows service felt down. Very useful to test with, if your Windows application makes it's own services.
