# Tools

Here I am going to post some part of my framework, which is making live, development and tests easier.

FilesLib.py - library for handling files and folders (list files, copy files, clear folders ...)

ImagesLib.py - library for handling Images (find different images, blend images ...)

ParsedLog.py - very simple class for handling logs.

GraphTimeLine.py - the tool for comparing results on a timescale. For example use autovision_v1 and autovision_v2 folders to see, how GrapTimeline working is.
